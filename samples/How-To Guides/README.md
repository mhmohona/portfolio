# How to Create Your Own Conda Forge Package

Ever wanted to share your awesome software with the world? Conda Forge is your go-to place! This guide walks you through the steps to package and distribute your software through Conda Forge. Donâ€™t worry, itâ€™s easier than it sounds, and super rewarding too!

## Why Conda Forge? 

[Conda Forge](https://conda-forge.org/) is like a big, welcoming library of software packages. It's community-driven and always up-to-date, and open source. If youâ€™re dealing with software that's a bit complex, like something written in C++ or needs compiling, Conda Forge is your hero.

## Ready, Set, Build!

### Before You Begin:

- **Conda and Pip:** Make sure you know the basics.
- **Install Conda Build:** Youâ€™ll need this tool. Just type `conda install conda-build` in your terminal.

### Creating Your Package:

1. **Create a `Meta.yaml` File:** This is your recipe â€“ it tells Conda all about your software, like what ingredients (dependencies) it needs. Need help? [Conda's documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/source/meta-yaml.html) has your back.

2. **Complex Software? Use Build Scripts:** If your package is more than just Python, you might need `build.sh` (for Linux/Mac) or `bld.bat` (for Windows). This tells Conda how to build your software.

3. **Build Your Package:** Here comes the most important part. With your `meta.yaml` and any necessary build scripts in place, it's time to create your Conda package. Open your terminal and run the following command:
```bash
conda build package_name
```
Replace `package_name` with the name of your software package. This will wrap up your software in a neat little package (a tarball, technically) that can be shared.

## Joining the Conda Forge Family

### How to Contribute:

1. **Fork Conda Forge Repo:** Go to [Conda Forgeâ€™s GitHub](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes) and fork the repository.

2. **Create a New Branch:** Name it after your software.

3. **Edit Meta.yaml File:** Modify the template to fit your software. Not sure? The template in the repo is super helpful.

4. **Submit a Pull Request:** Finished? Great! Now submit a pull request to Conda Forge.

### The Waiting Game:

- **CI Tests:** Your package will be tested automatically. Itâ€™s like a quality check to make sure everythingâ€™s working.

- **Make Changes if Needed:** If the tests find something, just tweak your recipe and try again.

### You Made It!

Once your package passes all tests and gets the green light from Conda Forge mods, itâ€™ll be added to the Conda Forge library and available on [Anaconda Cloud](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge).

## Keeping Your Package Fresh

### Bots to the Rescue:

Conda Forge has these nifty bots that help update your package when thereâ€™s a new version. Itâ€™s mostly hands-off for you.

### Making Big Changes:

Got a major update or new feature? Hereâ€™s what to do:

1. **Fork the Feedstock:** Your package will have its own feedstock repository. Fork it for major updates.

2. **Create a Pull Request:** Make your changes in the fork and submit a pull request to the feedstock.

3. **Wait for the Green Light:** Once your update passes all checks, itâ€™ll be live!

### Remember:

Donâ€™t edit directly in the feedstock repo â€“ always use forks and pull requests. This keeps things neat and avoids unnecessary builds.

## Need More Help?

Diving into documentation is super helpful. Check out [Conda Forgeâ€™s knowledge base](https://conda-forge.org/docs/) and [Conda Buildâ€™s documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/index.html). Stuck on something? The [Conda Forge Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io) is a great place to ask questions and get help from the community.

## And Youâ€™re Done!

Thatâ€™s it! Youâ€™ve just added your software to a huge library where thousands can find and use it. Pretty cool, right? Happy packaging, and welcome to the Conda Forge community! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ“¦
